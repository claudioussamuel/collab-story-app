# Duplicate Variable Name Fix

## Problem
The `HomeContent.tsx` file had two functions with the same name `handleStoryCreated`, causing an ECMAScript error:

```
the name `handleStoryCreated` is defined multiple times
```

## Root Cause
Two different `handleStoryCreated` functions were defined for different purposes:

1. **Event handler** for blockchain events (line 37)
2. **Callback handler** for story creation UI interactions (line 67)

## Solution Applied

### Renamed Event Handlers for Clarity
```typescript
// BEFORE - Conflicting names ❌
const handleStoryCreated = useCallback(() => {
  // Event handler for blockchain events
}, [refetchStories])

const handleStoryCreated = useCallback((story: Story) => {
  // Callback for story creation UI
}, [refetchStories])

// AFTER - Clear, distinct names ✅
const handleStoryCreatedEvent = useCallback(() => {
  // Event handler for blockchain events
  console.log("Story created - refreshing data")
  refetchStories()
}, [refetchStories])

const handleStoryCreated = useCallback((story: Story) => {
  // Callback for story creation UI
  setSelectedStory(story);
  refetchStories();
  setActiveView("write");
}, [refetchStories])
```

### Updated Event Hook Usage
```typescript
// Updated to use renamed event handlers
useBerniceEvents({
  onStoryCreated: handleStoryCreatedEvent, // ✅ Uses renamed event handler
  onSubmissionAdded: handleSubmissionOrVote,
  onVoteCast: handleSubmissionOrVote,
  onChapterFinalized: handleChapterFinalizedEvent, // ✅ Also renamed for consistency
})
```

## Changes Made

### 1. **Event Handler Renaming**
- `handleStoryCreated` → `handleStoryCreatedEvent` (for blockchain events)
- `handleChapterFinalized` → `handleChapterFinalizedEvent` (for consistency)

### 2. **Maintained Function Purposes**
- **`handleStoryCreatedEvent`**: Responds to blockchain `StoryCreated` events
- **`handleStoryCreated`**: Handles UI story creation completion
- **`handleChapterFinalizedEvent`**: Responds to blockchain `ChapterFinalized` events

### 3. **Updated Hook References**
- Updated `useBerniceEvents` to use renamed event handlers
- Maintained all existing functionality

## Result

- ✅ **No more duplicate variable names**
- ✅ **Clear separation of concerns** between event handlers and UI callbacks
- ✅ **Maintained all functionality** - both blockchain events and UI interactions work
- ✅ **Better code readability** with descriptive function names
- ✅ **ECMAScript error resolved**

## Function Purposes Clarified

| Function Name | Purpose | Trigger |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| `handleStoryCreatedEvent` | Refresh data when blockchain emits StoryCreated event | Blockchain event |
| `handleStoryCreated` | Handle UI flow when user creates a story | UI callback |
| `handleChapterFinalizedEvent` | Refresh data when blockchain emits ChapterFinalized event | Blockchain event |
| `handleSubmissionOrVote` | Refresh data for submission/voting events | Blockchain event |

The application now has clear, non-conflicting function names that properly separate blockchain event handling from UI interaction handling.
